This PySpark script implements collaborative filtering for video game recommendations, including data preprocessing, model training using ALS with parameter tuning via cross-validation, evaluation with RMSE, and computation of Precision and NDCG scores. The README.md should cover project overview, preprocessing, model training, evaluation metrics, running instructions, and potential enhancements.
